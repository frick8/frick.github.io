                <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/9323803256/Hero-Quest-BETA">Hero Quest</a></p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hero Quest is a fully-fledged launched beta game developed for my current employer and good friend. It includes hundreds of module scripts and over 45,000 lines of code, all written by me. The game features a robust system for character progression, quests, combat mechanics, cross-server parties, advanced npc pathfinding, procedural dungeon generation, etc.</p>

                <p><strong>Description:</strong> WFYB is a game made by Quenty, I was not a part of its original development, however, I made several content updates working with the rest of the staff team while the game was still active. I have since resigned as I needed to devote more time to Hero Quest.</p>

                <h2>Advanced Projectile System</h2>
                <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/14241546847/star-wars-commission">Gun Demo</a></p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This projectile system is very modular and expandable, can be moved to any game, and easily integrated as it uses binders. All the projectile settings are very configurable which lets a variety of projectiles be created, from bouncing ones that don't damage, to straight flying rockets that explode, all with proper cross-client syncing and server validation. Originally made for a group of star wars game makers, who have since scammed me.</p>
